# Typing
MEF-based extensible typing tutor

Many years ago, I realized that being unable to touch type was really slowing me down. I was also interested in getting a better understanding of DI and especially MEF. 
I also enjoy reading, so I thought if I could create a scrolling text that moved as fast as I could type, I could work on my typing speed and accuracy at the same time as
Reading the content. The idea was to have a generic text provider that could stream text from any source. I built it and used it for a while and it worked. 
I can now touch type! Many years later, I'm coming across this repositry and I still think the idea is cool and I'm greatful that I did this. 
I have no idea if the code still works and have thought it might fun to convert to .NET core and React (which I recently started learning).
If you are reading this, perhaps you will find something useful here.

Cheers,
Martin.
